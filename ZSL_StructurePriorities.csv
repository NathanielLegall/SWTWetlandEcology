Factors_to_Consider,Notes
Structure overtopped at high tide,"Structures that are overtopped during high tides can still be a high priority, if they do so infrequently"
Distance from the tidal limit,Highest priority to those impassable structures closest to the tidal limit
Habitat availability upstream of barrier,Highest priority to those structures for which eel passage would open up larger amounts of upstream habitat
Structures in close proximity upstream or downstream of the barrier,"Lower priority to barriers with other impassable barriers upstream and/or downstream nearby, unless there are plans in the forseeable future to also put in eel passage facilities at those structures"
Alternative routes around the structure,Highest priority should be given to impassable structures for which alternative routes (channels) around the catchment do not exist
Original purpose and current use of the structure,"For example, consideration should be given if it is a gaiging weir"
